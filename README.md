# hangerman-game
an interesting word game that enables a player to type a random letter until they get a word correctly, else the attempts will be used up and the game will be over, you will lose, if you get the word correctly you win. It uses the concepts of LEDs. When you start the game, red LEDs are shown following the length of the word chosen at random, guess your letters through the game to display green LEDs when you get the correct letter of the word which will be revealed. At the same time, time is ticking and when it reaches 0, you loose by default no matter how many correct letters you have guessed so far. Also the hangman parts will start showing for evey wrogly guessed characters. When you win, you get bubbles popping out of the screen, which is pretty cool. The game uses a numbe rof arrays to store random words, alphabets to be compared with the input from input array, a comparison is made through use of conditions, and that's also pretty much about the backbone of this hangman game. Its a word game, good for your brain.
